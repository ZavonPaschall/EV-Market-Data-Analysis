## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the electric vehicle (EV) market in the U.S. from 2010 onward. The goal was to create an interactive dashboard in Tableau that highlights key aspects of EV adoption, including vehicle distribution, geographical trends, and market share by manufacturer and model. The dashboard provides valuable insights into the growth patterns and the role of incentives in promoting clean energy vehicle adoption.

## Problem Statement
The analysis aimed to answer key questions about the EV market, including:
1. How has the adoption of EVs grown over the years?
2. Which states lead the country in EV adoption?
3. What are the top manufacturers and models contributing to the growth of the EV market?
4. What role do Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives play in EV adoption?

To address these questions, the project required creating specific visualizations that included:
- A time-based line/area chart showing total vehicles by model year.
- A map chart highlighting vehicle distribution by state.
- Bar charts for top 10 vehicles by make and model.
- Pie/Donut charts showing vehicle eligibility for CAFV incentives.

## Key Features and Skills Demonstrated
1. **Data Visualization:** The project used a variety of chart types (line/area, bar, map, pie/donut, tree map) to present different dimensions of EV data, demonstrating an ability to select appropriate visualizations for each question.
2. **Geospatial Analysis:** The state-wise vehicle distribution map helped in identifying the regions with the highest EV adoption, illustrating geographic trends effectively.
3. **Interactive Filtering:** The dashboard allows users to interact with filters to dive deeper into data for specific states or manufacturers.
4. **Dashboard Design:** The layout of the dashboard ensures easy navigation with distinct sections for overall trends, detailed breakdowns by make and model, and insights into the impact of CAFV incentives.

## Analysis Results
1. **Growth Trends:** The number of electric vehicles has seen a significant increase from 2011 to 2023, with a peak adoption rate in 2022, which is highlighted in the line chart showing vehicles by model year. In particular, Tesla shows overwhelming market dominance, contributing over 50% of the total vehicles.
2. **State Distribution:** California stands out with the highest adoption rates, while other states, like Texas and Florida, also show increasing trends in EV ownership.
3. **Top Manufacturers and Models:** Tesla leads the top 10 vehicle manufacturers, followed by Nissan and Chevrolet. The Tesla Model Y and Model 3 top the chart for individual models, making up nearly 37% of the total EV market.
4. **CAFV Incentives:** A significant proportion (42%) of EVs are eligible for CAFV incentives, indicating that incentives play a major role in accelerating vehicle adoption. However, there is also a considerable percentage (46%) of vehicles for which eligibility is unknown, showing a potential gap in data collection.

## Recommendations
1. **Encouraging Adoption in Other States:** While California dominates EV ownership, there’s room to explore and promote EV adoption in other regions with lower current adoption. Incentive programs tailored to these states could improve the adoption rate.
2. **Focus on Incentive Education:** A large percentage of EVs are unknown in terms of CAFV eligibility. Improving awareness and clarity around the eligibility of these vehicles for incentives could further encourage the switch to electric.
3. **Leveraging Market Dominance:** Tesla’s market dominance presents opportunities for collaboration and innovation. Other manufacturers could learn from their success in marketing and infrastructure.

## Why It Matters
Electric vehicles are critical in reducing carbon emissions and combating climate change. This dashboard offers an in-depth look into the factors influencing EV adoption, which can help stakeholders, from policymakers to automakers, make data-driven decisions to accelerate the shift towards sustainable transportation. By understanding market dynamics, geographical distribution, and the role of incentives, this project highlights areas for growth and innovation in the rapidly expanding EV market.
